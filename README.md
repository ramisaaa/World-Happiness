# World Happiness Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which is a data analysis and visualization project based on the [World Happiness Reports](https://github.com/ramisaaa/world-happiness). The World Happiness Report ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be, based on factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To understand the distribution and correlation of the variables in the dataset.
- To compare happiness scores and rankings across different regions and countries.
- To utilize Plotly and Seaborn libraries for interactive and informative visualizations.
- To analyze the data through hypothesis testing and linear regression to investigate the influences on happiness.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

### Data Loading and Cleaning
- Import necessary libraries
- Load data from CSV
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Preprocess and clean data

### Data Exploration and Visualization
- Conduct descriptive statistics
- Visualize data for an overview of the dataset
- Create interactive plots to compare happiness scores and rankings
- Explore correlations between happiness scores and other factors

### Hypothesis Testing and Linear Regression
- Formulate and test hypotheses about factors affecting happiness
- Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict happiness scores based on GDP per capita

### Conclusion and Future Work
- Summarize findings and project limitations
- Propose future research directions
